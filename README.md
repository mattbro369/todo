TOP | TODO LIST

This is my todo-list project for The Odin Project.

Languages used: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Other: Webpack

My goal with this project is to practise and hone my skills further in Javascript, specifically working with Objects and OOP, using the module design pattern to separate application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, keeping all of those things in separate modules. I'll also be using Webpack to manage to source files and assets. 


- The ‘todos’ are going to be objects that will be dynamically created using factory functions.
- At a minimum, todo-list items should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. 
- There should be a projects section or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

It should be able to do the following:

- view all projects
- view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities)
- expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- delete a todo
